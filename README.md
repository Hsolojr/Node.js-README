## Usage

### Navigating to the Proper Folder

Before generating the README.md file, navigate to the folder where you want to create the README.md file. Use the `cd` command to change directories if needed.

```bash
cd path/to/your/project/folder
```

### Running the Command

To run the Readme Generator, use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
node index.js
```

### Answering Prompts

After running the command, the terminal will prompt you with a series of questions about your project. Answer each question as accurately as possible. The questions will typically include details like:

- Project title
- Project description
- Installation instructions
- Usage instructions
- License information
- Contributing guidelines
- Testing instructions
- Contact information

Once you have answered all the prompts, the Readme Generator will generate a `README.md` file in your project folder with all the contents you provided. You can then review and edit the generated README.md file as needed.

## Generated README.md

The generated `README.md` file will contain all the information you provided in the prompts. It will have sections such as:

- Project title
- Description
- Table of Contents
- Installation instructions
- Usage instructions
- License information
- Contributing guidelines
- Testing instructions
- Contact information

You can further customize and enhance the generated README.md file to suit your project's needs.
